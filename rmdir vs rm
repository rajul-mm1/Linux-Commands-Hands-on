rmdir (Remove Directory)
 ** Used only for empty directories
 ** If the directory is not empty, it will not be deleted.

Example:
--> rmdir mydir  # Deletes 'mydir' only if it's empty
** If mydir contains files, you'll get an error: failed to remove 'mydir': Directory not empty

rm (Remove)
** Can delete files and directories (even non-empty ones).

Example:
--> rm file.txt  # deletes a single file
--> rm -d mydir  # deletes the mentioned directory if empty if not empty you will get an error: cannot remove 'mydir': Directory not empty

To Delete a Non-Empty Directory:
** If mydir is not empty, use:
--> rm -r mydir    # -r (recursive) → Deletes the directory and everything inside it.

** If you want to force delete without confirmation, use:
--> rm -rf mydir   # -f (force) → Ignores errors and deletes without asking.

*** ⚠ BE CAREFUL WITH rm -rf, AS IT CANNOT BE UNDONE. ***
