📁 Directory Navigation
1. Print current working directory
--> pwd

2. Change directory
--> cd dir_name

3.Move up one directory [this commands works in a hierarchy]
--> cd ..

4.Go to home directory
--> cd ~ or cd

5.Go to previous directory [this command runs for switching between different directories. It remembers the previous directory path you were working in]
--> cd -

📂 Creating Directories
1. Create a directory
--> mkdir dir_name  [ex: mkdir cloud_computing]

2. Create nested directories
--> mkdir -p path/to/dir [ex: mkdir -p projects/devops/docker]
NOTE: 
1. Creates a nested directory structure in one command.
2. If parent directories (like projects, devops, or docker) do not exist, it creates them automatically.
3. The -p flag means "make parent directories as needed" and prevents errors if they already exist. Without -p, this would fail if any parent directory doesn't exist.

🗑️ Deleting Directories
1. Removes an empty directory only
--> rmdir dir_name [ex: rmdir cloud_computing]

2. Remove a directory and its contents recursively. It asks for confirmation before deleting the folder. "Recursively" means performing an action not just on a folder, but on everything inside it, including subfolders, and their subfolders, and so on — like a chain reaction.
--> rm -r dirname [ex: rm -r cloud_computing] 

3. Force delete directory without confirmation
--> rm -rf dirname [ex: rm -rf cloud_computing]

🔁 Copying Directories
1. Recursively copy a directory
--> cp -r sourcedir destdir [ex: cp -r cloud_computing projects/devops/docker]

🔀 Moving/Renaming Directories
1. Rename directory
--> mv oldname newname [ex: mv cloud_computing cloud] 

2. Move directory to another path
--> mv dirname /new/location/ [ex: mv cloud /devops/aws/]

🔎 Finding Directories
1. Find directories by name
--> find /path -type d -name "dirname"   [ex: find /home/rajul -type d -name "scripts"]
NOTE:
** /path - it tells where to start searching
** -type d - it tells to only search the directories
** -name - it tells the name of the directory to be searched
** Case-insensitive search - find /home/rajul -type d -iname "scripts"

2. Find Directories Older Than 7 Days
find /home/rajul/projects -type d -mtime +7

3. Show directory structure in the form of a tree in hierarchical order
--> install tree if not installed - sudo apt update && sudo apt install tree
--> tree /home/rajul/projects
